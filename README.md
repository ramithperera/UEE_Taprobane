#Taprobane handcraft mobile application

##This mobile aplication for Sri Lankan handcraft online buying and selling 

Taprobane is the online platform that connects Sri Lankan handicrafts sellers and buyers and buyers which are in foreign and local. So, the purpose of this report is to create a handicraft shopping mobile application to promote Sri Lankan handcrafted goods. The majority of shopping sites concentrate on clothing, electronics, and other items, but nobody pays attention to handcrafted items. It is possible for customers (Local and Foreign) to directly purchase items from merchants via the Taprobane mobile application and this would help to Sri Lankan government to overcome dollar crisis and can uplift the living conditions of traditional handcrafters in Sri Lank
